# üèóÔ∏è 1. Multi-Tier Caching Architectures

### Netflix EVCache (Distributed Memcached)

* **Client-sharded caching**: EVCache wraps memcached with consistent hashing to shard data across nodes and AZs; reads are served locally, while writes replicate across zones for availability ([22.frenchintelligence.org][1], [GeeksforGeeks][2]).
* **Global replication via Kafka**: Netflix uses metadata-only messages in Kafka for cross-region replication, minimizing payloads and latency (sub-second 99th percentile) ([Netflix TechBlog][3]).
* **Cache warming**: New clusters are pre-warmed by dual-writing until the old cache expires, ensuring seamless capacity scaling .

### CDN + Edge + Client Caching

* **Open Connect Appliances (OCAs)**: Netflix and others place caches within ISPs. OCAs pre-populate popular content during off-peak hours, greatly reducing upstream bandwidth and latency ([Wikipedia][4]).
* **Multi-layer caching** from device/browser ‚Üí CDN edge ‚Üí regional caches (e.g., Netflix: 5-tier, Wix: proxy+local), optimizing latency and scaling ([22.frenchintelligence.org][1]).

## üéØ 2. Read-Heavy vs Write-Heavy Patterns
![img.png](images/readvswrite.png)
### Read-Heavy Systems

* **Replication + Denormalization**: Services like Spotify use geographically distributed read replicas with eventual consistency. Pinterest stores precomputed aggregates to eliminate expensive JOINs.
* **Cache aside (lazy-loading)** and **read-through caching** allow app-layer caches to maintain freshness with TTL or invalidation.

### Write-Heavy Systems

* **Kafka‚Äôs append-only log** design ensures high write throughput by using sequential disk I/O, batching, and delayed fsync ([DEV Community][5]).
* **Zero-copy transfers**: Kafka uses `sendfile()` or FileChannel.transferTo() to send data from disk directly to network sockets, minimizing CPUs cycles ([The Dev Learnings][6]).
* **Batched writes & queues**: Aggregating writes reduces I/O operations and improves efficiency.

## üîß 3. Advanced Cache Optimization Patterns

### Write-Through and Write-Behind

* **Write-through caching** updates both cache and datastore synchronously‚Äîensuring strong consistency.
* **Write-behind** defers datastore writes while acknowledging users immediately, offering higher throughput but riskier consistency.

### Memory-Mapped Files

* For write-heavy workloads, memory-mapped file I/O leverages OS page caches to improve both reads and durable writes automatically, blending benefits of RAM and disk.

## ‚öñÔ∏è 4. Consistency vs Performance

* **Read-heavy apps**: Accept eventual consistency; e.g., Netflix caches preferences globally but uses strong consistency for billing.
* **Write-heavy apps**: Demand immediate consistency and durability‚Äîfinancial or transactional systems can‚Äôt accept stale data.

---

## üí° 5. Operational Considerations & Paradoxes

* **Cache invalidation paradox**: Uber experienced higher latencies because cache invalidations cascaded across microservices‚Äîresolved by using write-through and selective invalidation.
* **Workload adaptability**: High-scale systems dynamically detect shifts in read/write ratios and adjust caching, replication, and scaling strategies accordingly.

## üîç Production-Centric Checklist
![img_1.png](img_1.png)
### Read-Heavy Systems:

* ‚úÖ Use read replicas (geo-aware) and denormalized storage.
* ‚úÖ Layer multi-tier caches with TTL & client-side caching.
* ‚úÖ Offload static content to CDNs and OCAs.
* ‚úÖ Monitor hit/miss rates, evictions, and stale data.

### Write-Heavy Systems:

* ‚úÖ Architect with append-only designs (LSM, Kafka).
* ‚úÖ Batch writes, queue operations, ensure idempotency.
* ‚úÖ Distribute load via sharding and write-optimized storage engines.
* ‚úÖ Observe durability guarantees (fsync, replication lag).

## üß† Key Takeaways

1. **Choose architecture to match your workload pattern**: read-heavy favors caching and replication; write-heavy favors append-logs and batching.
2. **Layer caches thoughtfully**: combine local device caches, edge CDNs, regional caches, and global replication.
3. **Understand the consistency-performance tradeoff**: eventual consistency works for reads; writes often need strong guarantees.
4. **Design for adaptability**: detect workload shifts and adjust strategies dynamically.
